  artisticProcess: "Using the dynamics of my family I tried to etch out a family
    dinner of ours and how we would interact. The energy is usually very volatile.
    Charcoal is my trademark but it\u2019s perfect for this piece. "
  mediumMethods: Charcoal
  inspiration: "I have a great connection with my family and truly place them above
    all else. My brothers, sisters and especially my parents appear in this piece.
    I could\u2019ve never imagined becoming the artist I am today without their influence.
    This piece isn\u2019t for my honor but in honor of them. "
