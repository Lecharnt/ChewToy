  artisticProcess: For this painting I awoke each morning and painted one stroke
    per day. Finally the piece was done after many years. It reminded me that there
    is beauty in every day!
  mediumMethods: Oil on canvas
  inspiration: The morning dew over the concrete jungle landscape inspires me every
    day. Buildings just grow taller and taller! I am the architect and the builder!
