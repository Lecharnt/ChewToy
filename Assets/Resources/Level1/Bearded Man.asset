  artisticProcess: "I did my best to paint from memory while on psychedelics they
    usually help my memory. Although I might\u2019ve gotten carried away with the
    colors. "
  mediumMethods: Water Color
  inspiration: "There was once a beautiful bearded man in my life and you know what,
    I just wanted to draw him and so I did as best as I could remember him. Hopefully
    he sees this painting one day and maybe calls me up who knows what\u2019ll happen."
